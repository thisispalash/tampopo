We can be anyone we want to be on the internet, so let's all be real, in the hopes of abolishing from this world duality we may rise above and all be cubed !

## The Revolution

At the end of the day, all of us are stories (some lucky one get to be songs); This project aims to connect stories and _web3_ by providing the space (in your time) for you to outpour your stories for the world. The world is filled with stories, which for one reason or another, are often silenced; no more! Web3 abstracts all entities into nodes, not caring if the node represents an idea, a machine, an organisation, or a person; Furthermore, these nodes can have their own economy, thereby, in some sense, enabling barter systems; or a global creative economy.

This project provides a platform for `users` to create `personas` and share stories as those `personas`; Upon story reads, the _storytellers_ are _rewarded_ by their reader's _attention_ (made tangible via `TP tokens`). The minting of fresh `TP` occurs upon persona registration (at `tampopo.eth`), story minting (at `emptyyourcup.com`), and on _thread pulling_ (at `pullmythread.com`). Furthermore, other tokens may be _streamed_ to mint `TP` at `<persona>.tampopo.eth`; which also forms the bridge to rest of web3 [read: DeFi].

Web3 also brings forth, and indeed hyperboles, the transactional nature of the modern world; or more accurately, the causal nature of life itself - every action has a consequence (may or maynot be equal in nature, or value). The action-reaction(s) of this private* network are as follows;
- For `storytellers` - The action of writing, and publishing, a story awards you with a certain number of freshly minted `TP` tokens. Moreover, as readers read, more `TP` tokens are minted to your name (or if you be so kind, to the community).
- For `readers` - As you _stumble upon_ and read a story, freshly minted `TP` tokens are _streamed_ to the storyteller. Think of it as your attention and interest being converted to `TP` tokens by the _majik_ of web3.
- On _seeing colour_ - The two main ways to interact with the network is via `emptyyourcup.com` and `pullmythread.com`. However, you may also visit `tampopo.eth` where you may choose the _persona_ [read: colour] you want to read [read: see] and there is a cost associated with this choice, at some constant rate per click.
- Being _invited_ - A storyteller may also choose to invite you to read a story (or the world, by making it public) where the [cost] rate in _seeing colour_ is now the rate of minting fresh `TP` tokens.

## Network Information

tampopo consists of three networks - i. the default `mainchain` where all the action happens; ii. a `draftchain` for storytellers to get some feedback on their stories prior to publishing; and iii. a `hidechain` for permissioned access to a story, ie, invite-only story views for more sensitive content. Each chain uses a different Ethereum chain (such as `homestead`, `ropsten`, etc.) for their unique capabilities, as explained further;

**mainchain** This is the default chain for the network, running as a layer-2 chain on the main Ethereum Network (`homestead`). A bunch of smart contracts help peg the value of `tP` tokens to ether, and thus real-world* value. Every public story that is publised to the network resides as a story hash on this chain.

**draftchain** This is the chain where the points are made up, and the rules don't matter. Effectively, it is the wild wild west, designed for more chaotic creations, as close to `main` conditions. As a result, implemented on Ethereum's `ropsten` network. The idea is to store drafts here, until it is ready to be published on the main network.

**hidechain** This is a Proof of Authority chain (as opposed to PoW (and maybe PoS) above) to enable DPoS voting, while separating the votes from money and its related data. Effectively, the aim here is to form something like Twitter's [Communities](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/testing-communities) because this network can also be used for whitsleblowing, or fighting injustice. In some [naive] way linking web3 and twitter, to give the (armchair) activists some teeth, if you will.


## Contributing Guidelines
> read: participating with the network

The beautiful thing about open-source, is that you can *copypasta*. Moreover, code is a language; one to express ideas in (shamelessly stolen from [Lex Clips](https://www.youtube.com/c/LexClips)), and as such these are my ideas, hence there is no contributing, per se, permitted. Having said that, since the entire repository is under a [copyleft license](), you are free to fork it or even just copy individual lines from any file (*note:* the license mentions stating source of code, but also emphasises no liability, thereby making a sort of honour system possible; so, will you be honourable?).

Also, the most ideal, and indeed quickest for it is designed as so, way to *contribute* to the network, is to *participate* in it - either by [emptying your cup]() or by [filling it](). Either link helps mine `tP` tokens, which are made real by purchases of stories as memorablia of the time shared together (across space) [as an NFT [read: ERC-1155 multitoken]]. Of course, you may read stories for free without paying anything, but then I would be obliged to refer you to the honour code mentioned above.

In summary, you create a persona on either website (`emptyyourcup.com` || `pullmythread.com`) to share your stories or consume others' stories (respectively). Either of those activities mines fresh `tP` network tokens, which are made real* and consumable using some [web3 magic](). The idea behind the network is effectively an idea, that of existential dread - for aren't we all just stories at the end of it all? If so, why not become immortal together and scream out our [colourful] stories into the abyss*? This network is that abyss, with some effort to make sense of the chaos as well, of course.

### Future Considerations

- [ ] tampopo [dot] eth for *meaningful* and insightful stats of the network
- [ ] alternate document formats, such as poetry, plays, scripts, etc.
- [ ] openAI integrations for *fun* and convenience
