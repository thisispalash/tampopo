We can be anyone we want to be on the internet, so let's all be real, in the hopes of abolishing from this world duality we may rise above and all be cubed !

## The Revolution

At the end of the day, all of us are stories (some lucky one get to be songs); This project aims to connect stories and _web3_ by providing the space (in your time) for you to outpour your stories for the world. The world is filled with stories, which for one reason or another, are often silenced; no more! Web3 abstracts all entities into nodes, not caring if the node represents an idea, a machine, an organisation, or a person; Furthermore, these nodes can have their own economy, thereby, in some sense, enabling barter systems; or a global creative economy.

This project provides a platform for `users` to create `personas` and share stories as those `personas`; Upon story reads, the _storytellers_ are _rewarded_ by their reader's _attention_ (made tangible via `TP tokens`). The minting of fresh `TP` occurs upon persona registration (at `tampopo.eth`), story minting (at `emptyyourcup.com`), and on _thread pulling_ (at `pullmythread.com`). Furthermore, other tokens may be _streamed_ to mint `TP` at `<persona>.tampopo.eth`; which also forms the bridge to rest of web3 [read: DeFi].

Web3 also brings forth, and indeed hyperboles, the transactional nature of the modern world; or more accurately, the causal nature of life itself - every action has a consequence (may or maynot be equal in nature, or value). The action-reaction(s) of this private* network are as follows;
- For `storytellers` - The action of writing, and publishing, a story awards you with a certain number of freshly minted `TP` tokens. Moreover, as readers read, more `TP` tokens are minted to your name (or if you be so kind, to the community).
- For `readers` - As you _stumble upon_ and read a story, freshly minted `TP` tokens are _streamed_ to the storyteller. Think of it as your attention and interest being converted to `TP` tokens by the _majik_ of web3.
- On _seeing colour_ - The two main ways to interact with the network is via `emptyyourcup.com` and `pullmythread.com`. However, you may also visit `tampopo.eth` where you may choose the _persona_ [read: colour] you want to read [read: see] and there is a cost associated with this choice, at some constant rate per click.
- Being _invited_ - A storyteller may also choose to invite you to read a story (or the world, by making it public) where the [cost] rate in _seeing colour_ is now the rate of minting fresh `TP` tokens.

## `TP` Tokens

Trivially `TP` stands for `tampopo`, but more interestingly [read: creatively], it stands for `timepass` (or `toilet paper`, depending on the goggles); because, the whole point of this project is to pass time by sharing and hearing stories and connecting with strangers* on the interwebs. Indeed, is there a better way to pass your time; for here you may _check out_ people in the convoluted and interactive _library_ and (perhaps) learn something new.

**tokenomics** As you have probably guessed by now, there is no real upper limit to the number of `TP` tokens. `tampopo.eth` is the main address of the project, which holds the minted `TP` tokens and the donated alts. This address also serves as the community fund, helping out those who can not (or may not) help themselves; kinda like pay-it-forward coffee. Additionally, as each _storyteller_ is identified with a subdomain of `tampopo.eth` (as `<persona>.tampopo.eth`), the mint and alt duality exists for every storyteller as well; every effort is made to make the private keys human friendly.

**cryptonomics** The other part of the `TP` tokens (or any crypto token for that matter) is the **private** key. Like addresses, private keys are not _human friendly_. Some attempt is made to abstract the keys to _n_ word seeds, however even these are not nice to remember. Treating seeds as elongated passwords seems like a good idea, and as such users are encouraged (and assisted in) to create _memorable_ seeds which can then be used to regenerate their private key. Additionally, multi-sig is used extensively to add another layer of complexity, and to share the _burden_ of knowledge.
> ___note___ these ideas are still quite raw and in need of further exploration into the hard math behind ECC; a possible solution lies in using semaphores from ethereum foundation's Privacy and Scaling explorations group, combined with _creative_ suggestions


### Current* Constants
