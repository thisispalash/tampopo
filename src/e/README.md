# Empty Your Cup
> and lay down threads for others to pull !!

We can be anyone we want to be on the internet, so let's all be real, in the hopes of abolishing from this world duality we may rise above and all be cubed !

## Mind, Body, Soul

Being three dimensional (cubed) requires being aware of `mind`, `body`, and `soul`. With this project, you can empty your mind; ever read about or seen Albus Dumbledore empty his mind into the [Pensieve](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Pensieve)? Well, this is the Public Pensieve where we* can be free, and with the wonders of web3, be tangibly appreciated for our `minds` !

To continue the analogy, our `body` may use any wand such as the phone, or the laptop to empty our mind onto this Public Pensive; while the `soul` is us* spinning the yarn using our* `body` to empty our* `mind` onto this Public Pensieve, `tampopo.eth` !! 

## Coloured Threads

You first pick a colour for your story to describe the mood of the story (or of you). Then you spin your yarn, threading [read: linking] the reader along as you empty yourself, or at least the story or the idea, onto the internet; a thread to reel yourself back from the abyss, if you will. For a demo (and an example) see `admin.tampopo.eth/demo`.
