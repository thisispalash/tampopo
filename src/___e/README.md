# Empty Your Cup
> and lay down threads for others to pull !!

We can be anyone we want to be on the internet, so let's all be real, in the hopes of abolishing from this world duality we may rise above and all be cubed !!

## Mind, Body, Soul

Being three dimensional (cubed) requires being aware of `mind`, `body`, and `soul`. With this project, you can empty your mind; ever read about or seen Albus Dumbledore empty his mind into the [Pensieve](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Pensieve)? Well, this is the Public Pensieve where we* can be free, and with the wonders of _web3_, be tangibly appreciated for our `minds` !

To continue the analogy, our* `body` may use any wand such as the phone, or the laptop to empty our* mind onto this Public Pensive; while the `soul` is us* spinning the yarn using our* `body` to empty our* `mind` onto this Public Pensieve, `tampopo.eth` !! 

## Coloured Threads

You first pick a colour for your story to describe the mood of the story (or of you). Then you spin your yarn, _threading_ [read: linking] the reader along as you empty yourself, or at least the story or the idea, onto the internet; a thread even to reel yourself back from the abyss, if you will. For a demo (and an example) see `admin.tampopo.eth/demo`.

## `TP` Tokens

With the wonders of _web3_, you can be appreciated, even monetarily, which is linked to the attention of your reader. There are three ways to _earn_ [read: mint] using this website;

- On registration, you create a persona at `tampopo.eth` which creates a _subdomain_ for you to share, `<persona>.tampopo.eth`. This is the main address (web and eth) for your stories or yarn balls or cups. This mints `69 TP` to your name.
- On every published story, `420 TP` will be minted to your name. You also have the option to forgo these tokens and instead have them be available in the community fund (at `tampopo.eth`).
- On every story read, `(420/n * m) TP` is minted (or streamed) on every link click [read: thread pull], where `n` is the number of links or pulls in your story, and `m` is the multiplier factor, defined by the number of stumbles to your story on `pullmythread.com`
- Finally, you can share your personal page `<persona>.tampopo.eth` and [stream] mint `6.9 TP` per click as the reader _sees colour_ by selecting specific stories to read;
