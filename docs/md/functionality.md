# How it works
> using a little bit of this and a little bit of that

Effectively you share stories in a novel way, using the full interactibility of the web, to the network. The network incentivices story reading and connecting such that story tellers may earn actual, real-world* money for the stories they share. Though this project was designed keeping non-fiction stories in mind (indeed, reality is often stranger than fiction), the network may also be used as a general publishing platform for multiple use cases, such as internal blogs, articles, poetry, literature, etc.


## Empty Your Mug
> do it now, [here]()

This is the first way to participate in the network. Essentially, you create a *persona* at `emptyyourmug.com` and then write a story. The network ensures that this is at no cost to the storyteller, by effectively pushing the burden of cost or payment on the reader. In some ways, this network attempts to convert attention captured by a story into real* money, by using the best of web3 - permissionless entry, clever math, and non-fungible [multi] tokens.


## Pull My Thread
> do it now, [here]()

This is the second way to participate with the network. As a reader, you stumble upon stories which *optimistically* mines network tokens. These are *optimistic* in that at some point you would reach a story with the persona you create that moves you so much that you must mint a memorablia. When you do, your prior story reads will be published and merged with the network, and the longer since your last memorablia, the higher is the network fee (for larger is the data being merged).


## Ideas explored

A bunch of ideas are being explored through this project. They are presented below for a convenient (yours, *and* mine) overview,

### Mood as Colour
> to enable mindful reading and true connections

The idea is that we typically perceive reality, and thereby others' stories, filtered through the mood we currently are in. This propject tries to make you mindful of the goggle colour you may happen to wear, and also provides goggles to wear, just for the *thrill* of it.


### Alan Trotter
> using the internet to form dynamic reading experiences

I first saw the website, and the novel interactive way of storytelling, around three years back. However, whenever I showed the website to anyone else, they would first think of engagement and subsequently advertising revenue. This bothered me, for I could see the engagement tracking as a useful tool for education. Fortunately, with the wonders of web3, this network effectively becomes a library of human* stories which one may check out to read at any time, often free of cost; and in doing so, ie, in checkout out a story and reading it, they may enrich the storyteller (and themselves). So, in programming terms, `tampopo` is `alan++`.


### Time is Money, web3
> the only true currency we have is our time and attention

The network, using web3 majik (ie, bringing economic tools and ideas to the general public, and abstracting the workings using cs and internet), aims to convert your *engagement* with a story, to real-world* money. The idea is that we are temporal beings, born of a warm soup, and as such everything else is made up. The only true currencies we have is our time and what we do with it. Since you would likely spend your time in reading others' stories, two major things happen (by design) - i. you mine network tokens, not for yourself but for the one who captured your attention; and ii. you hopefully reach a *valuable* story that inspires, recharges, or simply resonates with you, maybe enough for you to mint a memorablia of the story.


### One Globe, One World
> permissionless entry, as a writer or a reader

The internet (nothing special really, just a big hive mind of connected computers) has almost erased borders with making accessing global information easier. As we get more connected, the growth is also exponential, even if only because of parallel but modular development. web3 is the latest in this growth, a milestone that makes all tools of humanity accessible by all of humanity (really, ethereum is a global, decentralised, permissionless computer!). The idea here is to learn from recent social media *scandals*, and in a true web3 fashion, make real, *no-bullshit* connections, incentivised by network parameters, which are inherently transparently, *and accessibly*, defined. One way it does this is emphasis on *enforced* mindfulness (such as mood == colour), by using the concept of transactions on web3; or 


### *Making Money*
> please, the network is about stories, with money as a side effect

Oftentimes, the stories that need to be screamed from the rooftops are the ones without said rooftops. Hence, the project was designed keepng *assistance* in mind, and since today's world *runs on money*, incentives, in the form of charity and *guilt-trips* and *reasoning* and ***tokenomics***, are baked into the network for storytellers to *get their dues*, effectively, by converting a reader's attention into money. More grandly however, this platform can be used as an organisation of resources to fight injustice ***anywhere*** or for simple publishing. Moreover, [Open]AI [GPT-3] is [planned to be] used extensively so man and machine may work together (to make merry).

#### `tP` tokens
> Optimistically mined to the storyteller or the community at large (if paid forward)

Each link click helps in analytics, ie, tracking how far a reader has progressed in a story (and on extension, average story reads, ranking, etc.). Typically this helps in showing the readers highly targeted advertisements, or highly relevant content, but this project uses it to *mine* network tokens. This mining is *optimistic* as this is done locally in the reader's browsers, in the *hopes* that they will publish and merge their activity with the network (by purchasing a memorablia). Meme numbers (`69` and `420`) are used as constants, because why not?


#### Minting NFTs
> Making the optimism real* by sending actual money against the time spent

As a reader reads stories (through a persona), they mine `tP` tokens which are stored locally in the browser. To submit the mining activity to the network, and thus also reward the storytellers whose stories you read, you must do so manually. This is done by minting a new ERC-1155 token (NFT) for the story that moved you so (remember you cannot come back to the same story by name), which lets you pay for the network fees (smart contract execution cost) and submits a *proof* of the batches you have mined.


### AI Assistance
> The singularity doesn't need to be *spoonfed*, we can rise too

Inspired by [this TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aR5N2Jl8k14), the network aims to connect the universal machine that is the computer with the universal explorer that is the human. Computers (and by extension the internet, web3, ...) are tools for the use of humanity, and should be a right for every individual in *that humanity*. Machines have always helped humans let go of mundane, repititive tasks such that the man-machine collective becomes greater than the sum of its parts; computers are just the current iteration of human technology (beginning with language, marching on to artificial life), and as such they were designed to be the *universal machines*. It is not only every person's right, but also a neccessity, to benefit from the widespread adoption of these machines (from independent sensors, to complete supercomputers, and everything in between). Hence, the network aims to make a human's life easier by enabling better storytelling, built using cutting edge technology and ideas, so as to enable connections across the globe.
