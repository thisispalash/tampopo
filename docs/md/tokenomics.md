# `tP` Tokens
> `tamPopo` or `timePass` or `toilet Paper` or ..?

A large part of web3 or blockchain is a *cryptocurrency* or, as is more accurate, network tokens. These tokens are used to inccentivise *good behaviour* for the *public good*. In this network, the entire burden of payment is put on the reader, with a catch - the reader may choose never to publish their activity, in which case they have *freely seen the game outside an electronics store*. However, and more importantly, the network aims to convert attention (and *engagement*) to `$$$` using a bunch of L2 tricks on the ethereum `mainnet`. The fruit of these tricks is published to the network when a story so moves a reader that they *mint* it as an NFT (ERC-1155 multi-token) and in purchasing the NFT, publish the changes as a *proof of knowledge*. This also provides value to the network `tP` tokens without having them be listed on exchnages.


## *optimistic* Mining
> local merkle tree formed, recording *persona* activity

As mentioned above, activity on the network is stored locally as a merkle root, in order to simulate a local sidechain. This *mines* `tP` tokens to their respective owners (storytellers or community) and stores the final hash locally (as a small cookie). This *sidechain* or merkle root (and mining data) is publsihed to the network and merged on interacting with a smart contract. Moreover, the total mined tokens are pegged against the purchase price (ie, the price paid for minting, minus network fees [read: gas for contract execution]), and the deposited tokens are *swapped* to `ether`, the network token of Ethereum.

The cost of merging this data is thereby split two ways; i. in actual money, when stories are minted and past [local] transactions (and mining [read: reading] activity) are made public, and ii. in kind, through your time and attention, and your device's resources in running services in the background. The first is made tangible by pegging the network `tP` token to the Ethereum network token, `ether`, while the other is made tangible through *web3 mining*.


## ether Backing
> stories may be minted in any token, but are always converted to *ether*

To make things easier, the network `tP` token is pegged to `ether`, the network token of the blockchain on which this network resides. The *price* of `ether` can be then looked at in the denominator of your choice to determine the *real world* value of the `tP` token. This indirect approach to determining network value is deliberate, in that stories should not subject to market forces such as margins or shorts, ie, betting that a story sucks, and borrowing money to do so seems inherently *vile*.

A smart contract (three actually) manage the exchange of values. The primary way the tokens are exchanged are through `tampopo.eth` where visitors may depoit `eth` and withdraw a token of their choosing, or directly fulfil a [personal] token request. The displayed, and thus asking, price is based on the TWAP* prices determined by oracles. It may help to think of it as a giant liquidity pool with `tP`, `eth`, and *stable coins* [read: CDBCs], whose aim is to only have `tP` and `eth` left in its pool to form a current and accurate pegging ratio. The stable coins can be withdrawn by depositing `tP` or `eth` which inherently helps to determine the *price ratio*, as pegged to `ether`.

## Tokenomics
> No upper limits, positive sum games yo !

Hello Dogecoin! The meme network had one cool idea (among others) - that of limitless mining. Effectively, it is saying that as time progresses, the value generated will necessarily increase (value determined by quantity of tokens mined, not quality [read: price]). This seems apt for positive sum games, as opposed to competitive zero sum games. This changes the *narrative* from *me vs you* to *us vs them*, which at the end of the day, is what I would like science, technology, web3! to represent; the *them* being *ignorance* and *darkness* and *silence*. Hence, the tokens are mined liberaly, with every network interaction. This also serves to set the foundation for automated data mining (and rewards) using [Open]AI.

The worry, or fear, is that someday the value of `tP` might be *0 USD* or *0 GBP* or *0 EUR*; but in such a case, the goals of the network would still be achieved. Since, making money is a side effect of using web3 technology and not the point of it. This is also to emphasize the profoundity of moving beyond money, as money is simply a means to an end; made tangible by the majic of web3 - if everyone is a god, there are no gods; ie, it brings the tools of the economy, previously *held* by and in gated communities, and makes it accessible for entities as small as IoT sensors, to individuals, to large corporations and organisations. This network aims to be a step in that direction by abstraction away the economics to enable the *barter* of attention and engagement with stories. The hope is of course that as the network grows in size, so do the number of custodians* simply *donating* (money *and* time) for the benefit of the network.


## Current* Constants
> i think they're quite funny, don't you?

There are mining opportunities with every interaction in the network
- First, to write or read stories, you must create a persona which mines tokens to the persona's name [read: address]
- Secondly, on publishing a story to the `mainnet`, tokens are mined to the publisher's (storyteller) name [read: address]
- Then, on every story read [read: thread pull], tokens are mined to the storyteller's name [read: address]
  - When publishing a story, the persona may choose to *pay [mined tokens] forward* such that the tokens are distributed to the pool rather than the persona
  - The mine rate is a function of the depth of story, the number of stumbles of the reader, and the engagement of the reader
  - This is *optimistic* in nature, in that it is only stored locally, and published on minting a story in the future
- Finally, readers may also choose a specific story to read [read: choose a coloured goggle to wear] which cost a little extra

### numbers
> variations of *69* and *420*, because why not?

- persona creation : `69 tP`
- story publishing : `420 tP`
- link rateÂ : `(420 / d) * m ** n tP` per click
  - `d` : depth of story reached
  - `m` : number of stumbles till story
  - `n` : number of stories minted
- choice rate : *some variation of `6.9 tP`*
- decimal places : Only two, to use already present real-world* money associations
