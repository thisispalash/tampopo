# External Projects Used

This project ([`emptyyourmug.com`](), [`pullmythread.com`](), and [`tampopo.eth`]()) would not be possible or indeed useable or useful if it weren't for the existence and accessibility of the following projects, ideas, code.


## web3 Projects
> * Core projects, without with tampopo wouldn't be possible
> ** [Hackathon](https://showcase.ethglobal.com/ethonline2021/tampopo-dot-eth) sponsors, for enhanced UX (and `$$$`) and customisatbility

### The Ethereum Project*
> The original decentralised computer

The network is essentially defined as a set of smart contracts running on Ethereum's `mainnet` (and `ropsten`, `gÃ¶rli`), with the web3 entrypoint at `tampopo.eth`. The network is a *L2 sidechain** using local *optimistic mining* and on-chain *zk-rollups* to submit local batches. Moreover, the native network tokens `tP` that are mined, are ultimately pegged to `ether`, the native token of the Ethereum Project.


### Ethereum Name Service*
> Human friendly web3 addresses

ENS is used foremost as mentioned above, but more importantly, and interestingly, it is used to enable *personas* on the network. Each persona *minted* (as `<persona>.tampopo.eth`) mines some `tP` tokens for the network, and also provides a starting point for that persona's *stats*. Moreover, a reader may read, or a storyteller may write, as different personas over different themes, which is also made possible through ENS.


### Gas Station Network*
> Any token gas, the web3 MVC

GSN is used so readers can contribute in any token, and writers may receive in any token. Effectively three contracts handle the integration - one for deposits, one for withdrawals, and one for oracles.

#### Chainlink**
> TWAP prices, future may include *preferred* oracles

#### Superfluid**
> Stream every click, makes the idea of `attention + time == money (== value)` most tangible


### EthBlockArt**
> For pretty pictures, future may involve [moving potraits](https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/hogwarts-portraits) using OpenAI to great *gif story moods*

NFT art generated for minted ERC-1155 multi-tokens, as a function of the story, story depth reached, rollup zk-proof, persona, etc.


### Rarible Protocol*
> The OP set of NFT contracts, open source and with *lazy minting*


### The Graph Network*
> Indexing the web (three)


### web3.storage*
> Fast, easy, and free IPFS


## OpenAI [future considerations]
> GPT-3 is awesome holy shit djcvndcvj;weqbdefwc !!!!


## Inspirations (and academia)

Apart from external projects used directly, the design of the network has been heavily influenced by the following, and as a result seems apt to be mentioned, in the interest of accessible transparency.

### `git` and GitHub
> *merging* optimistically mined tokens by personas on *pull requests*

### Merkle Trees
> used extensively for procedural reconstruction (as opposed to data storage) and for zk capabilities

### Alan Trotter
> The entire project is effectively [alan](https://alantrotter.com/)[+](https://emptyyourmug.com/)[+](https://pullmythread.com/)
