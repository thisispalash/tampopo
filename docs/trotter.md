# Alan Trotter
> check him out - [allantrotter.com](https://alantrotter.com)

This project is effectively `alan++` in that it extends Alan's style of storytelling to web3, ie, monetising link expansions and clicks. This is done using web3 majik in general and clever protocol schemes, read, creative problem solving.

## Mind, Body, Soul
> compare with Hue, Saturation, Luminosity in `colours.md`

Alan's [homepage](https://alantrotter.com) opens with three lines - Hello \ My name is Alan \ I write fiction. I compare this with `mind`, `body`, and `soul`, wherein the `mind` says hello (to the world), the `body` informs the reader of the storyteller's ego, and the `soul` is where the *fun* lies. This standardisation (and indeed restriction) is done to make encoding of stories (and link expansions) as merkle trees easier, and also becuase constraints beget creativity.

Hence, each `persona` that is minted has a `mind`, `body`, and `soul`; along with stories they read and write (as ERC-1155 tokens*). The artwork that is generated is a result of the story, the persona's unique characteristics, the story depth reached, and all hashes (and proofs for the rollup) to keep things fresh and interesting.

## Trotter Merkle Tries
> tokens are leaves, hashed to form phrases, to form paragraphs, to form stories \
> _TODO_ description

### conversion
> input doc to a merkle tree, root is the start of story, each leaf a dead end \
> _TODO_ description


### inversion
> regular trie to an inverted one, so the reader can follow a path from leaf to root \
> _TODO_ description
